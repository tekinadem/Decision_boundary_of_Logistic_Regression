# Decision_boundary_of_Logistic_Regression
# 1. Decision boundaries for Logistic Regression
# 2. Using PolynomialFeatures with Logistic Regression
#     At times, given features might come short to explain output, or the output might be a polynomial function of inputs.
#     If this is the case, LogisticRegression can be trained on polynomial features.
# 3. Cross validation to find the best polynomial degree
